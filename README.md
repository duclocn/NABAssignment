# Guideline to run my project
1. Download and install JDK 1.8 or higher (suggested using JDK 1.8 or 1.11)
2. Download and install Eclipse for Windows (I'm using Windows OS for coding): https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
3. Clone my project and import one to Eclipse. (I'm building Framework as Hybrid. It means that I will add libraris that I want into Project manually)
4. Open "automation-nab/resouces and right click on "runSearchFunctionTestcase.xml" > Run As -> TestNG Suite for starting Automation.

P/S: I also attached file "htmlReport.html" in target/HtmlReports to demonstrate that all testcases are passed on my system.

Thanks!
